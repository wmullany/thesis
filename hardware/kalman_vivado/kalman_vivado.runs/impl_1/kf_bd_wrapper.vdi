ERROR: [DRC UTLZ-1] Resource utilization: Register as Flip Flop over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more Register as Flip Flop cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 28890 of such cell types but only 28800 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device.)
